		<h2>MarkLogic Run/Debug Modes</h2>
		<p>
			The radio buttons on the Edit Configurations dialog select the mode by which XQuery will be executed on MarkLogic.
			There are four modes, the first two of which apply to both Run and Debug.  The second two
			only apply to debugging.
		</p>
		<p>
			These modes are:
		</p>
		<p></p>

		<h3>Ad Hoc (eval)</h3>
			<p>
				The content of the selected XQuery file, which must be a main module, will be sent to MarkLogic
				and executed as an Ad Hoc query using <code>dbg:eval</code>.  External variables may be passed to the query.
				Library modules may only be imported if they exist in the path of the appserver (the module's effective path
				will be the appserver root).  Library modules in the IntelliJ workspace may not be visible at runtime.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mode runs requests on the TaskServer rather than the configured appserver.
				The appserver is used by the debugger to control the submitted request as it runs on the TaskServer
				This means that no output will ever be produced by the request because there is no path to return the
				requests' output to the debugger output window (the future variable mechanism as with <code>xdmp:spawn</code> is not available when debugging).
				If you need to see the output of a debugged process, use the Capture Appserver mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				Requests running on the TaskServer will also not be able to see any HTTP request values.
				The only way to pass HTTP request variables to a debugged request is by using the Capture Appserver mode.
				The same applies to Invoke Mode.
			</p>
			<p></p>

		<h3>Invoke</h3>
			<p>
				The selected module will be invoked by URI, as determined by the selected XQuery file.  The
				content of the selected file will <i>not</i> be sent to MarkLogic.  The module will be invoked
				by name via the appservers root path on MarkLogic.
			</p>
			<p>
				This option only works properly if MarkLogic's appserver is configured
				to have its root point at a filesystem directory within the IntelliJ workspace.  By telling the MarkLogic
				plugin where the appserver root is, it can adjust the relative paths so that the IntelliJ
				can see the source when stopped at a breakpoint.  Use the dialog to select the local directory
				that corresponds to the configured appserver root in MarkLogic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: It is possible to use this run mode with code in a Modules database or an unreadable filesystem
				location (such as MarkLogic running on a remote system).  But in that case an identical copy of the
				code must be placed in the local IntelliJ workspace.  MarkLogic reports filenames and line numbers and
				these must match what IntelliJ sees.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mode runs requests on the Task Server rather than the configured appserver.  This means that
				no output will ever be produced.  This is necessary to be able to run and debug a request from a
				single appserver.  If you need to see the output of a debugged request, user the Capture Appserver mode.
			</p>
			<p></p>

		<h3>Capture Appserver</h3>
			<p>
				This run mode "grabs" an appserver (specified by name, appserver ID, or port number).  It then waits for the
				next request to start on that appserver.  When one does, the request will be halted for debugging just before
				the first expression.  If no request starts on the captured appserver within the timeout period (configurable
				in seconds, default 120) then the debug session will abort and release the appserver.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: Because of the way expressions are mapped to source lines in the MarkLogic API, "just before the first expression"
				may seem like a nonsensical location when it displays the initial debug cursor.  This is normal (see the Wiki for more info),
				just click Step Into to execute the first expression.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any output created will be sent to the captured app server, not the IntelliJ debugger run window.
				Note however that because of the way requests run on MarkLogic, any output produced will only be seen when the
				full request completes without error.  To see information as the request is stepped through the debugger,
				consider using <code>xdmp:log</code> calls and tailing the MarkLogic server <code>ErrorLog.txt</code>code> log file.
			</p>

			<p>
				This run mode is useful for debugging code "in-situ", running in its native environment, rather than on the Task Server.
				In some cases, such as when the code being debugged depends on HTTP parameters, this is the only way to debug the code without modification.
				It is useful for tracing requests to REST endpoints, for example.  It can also capture XCC requests from Java/.Net applications.
			</p>

			<p>
				This run mode involves two appservers.  The one that you configure here with the Capture Appserver run mode is
				the primary appserver that the debugger will use to communicate with MarkLogic.  This is the one that will grab
				another appserver, identified in the Run Configuration.  This is <b>not</b> the one that the request to be debugged
				will run on.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second appserver is the one that will captured and run the request to be debugged.  That appserver need not be defined here as
				another Run Configuration (although it can be).  The primary appserver will capture the second appserver when the
				next request starts on it.  That request can be started in any usual way, such as by an HTTP/REST request, an XCC
				request, etc.  The most common method is to use a command line tool like curl or wget, or a GUI REST client like POSTMan or similar.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> It is important that the primary appserver be configured
				so that its root points to the code to be debugged (eg, matches the root of the appserver being captured),
				and that the Appserver Root path be set properly in the run configuration so that IntelliJ's filesystem paths can be mapped correctly.
				When the debugger hits a breakpoint, it returns edit control to IntelliJ with a reference to a file and line number.
				If IntelliJ cannot find the referenced source file on disk, then the debug runner will hang when a breakpoint is reached.
				The "Appserver Root" setting lets the plugin map the path from MarkLogic's view to IntelliJ's view.
			</p>
		<p></p>

		<h3>Grab and Debug a Running Request</h3>
			<p>
				Not yet implemented.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mode will provide a means by which a running request may be attached to and stepped with the debugger.
				To work successfully, the appserver root path must be set properly, as for Invoke mode.  It is possible to debug code running from
				a Modules Database, but a corresponding source tree must be in this project's workspace with the path of the
				code at the appserver root configured here.  When the debugger stops, if it does not find the corresponding
				source file then it hang and the request may need to be resumed of killed by hand..
			</p>
			<p>
				Most requests on MarkLogic run very quickly.  This mode will primarily be useful for diagnosing requests that
				have gotten stuck or are running away.
			</p>
