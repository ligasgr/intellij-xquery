# IntelliJ XQuery Support + MarkLogic Debugger Plugin
Provides support for [XQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/xquery/) language version 3.0 and 3.1 in [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
This project is forked from the excellent [XQuery Support](https://github.com/ligasgr/intellij-xquery) plugin project by
[Grzegorz Ligas](https://github.com/ligasgr).

This is an extension to that plugin which adds debugging support for MarkLogic.  It also includes in-IDE documentation for W3C
XQuery and MarkLogic extension function APIs.

This plugin is pre-release and still under active development.  If you would like to participate as a beta tester, please contact
[Ron Hitchens (ron@overstory.co.uk)](mailto:ron@overstory.co.uk).  If you're impatient, you can clone this repository and run
```./gradlew dist``` from the top.  This 
will produce a ```.zip``` file under ```build/distributions```.  That file can be installed from the Plugins section of
IntelliJ Preferences by selecting "Install from disk".  If you try this plugin, please let us know how well it works for you.
